### Definition of ML
Machine learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science that focuses on the using data and algorithms to enable AI to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy

### My Research:
In-depth analysis of the impact of weather data and avalanche incidents. First, I create datasets of avalanches in Europe, based on the EAWS website, then I retrieve historical weather data from the public API, matching each incident. After that, I do data analysis and NN-model training.
